Bui came to K+M from Romera restaurant in New York, where she worked on the highly praised chocolate program: a groundbreaking single-origin, bean-to-bar effort that was pioneering for a fine-dining restaurant. At Romera, Bui worked with neurologist-chef Miguel Sanchez Romera, who introduced her to the idea of integrating health, science, art and gastronomy. 

Bui also honed her chocolate-making skills as the head chocolatier at Cacao Prieto in Brooklyn. Before focusing exclusively on chocolate, she worked in the pastry kitchens of some of New York City’s finest restaurants, including Le Bernardin, Union Square Cafe, Gotham Bar and Grill and Daniel. 

Bui’s previous work includes working at the United Nations Development Program, where she helped developing countries get funding and technical resources and establish networking infrastructure. Bui holds a BA in literature and writing from the Eugene Lang College at The New School.
