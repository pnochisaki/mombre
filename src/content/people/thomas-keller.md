Keller’s restaurant group also includes French bistro Bouchon, with locations in Yountville, Las Vegas and Beverly Hills; Per Se in New York; Ad Hoc in Yountville; and Bouchon Bakeries in New York, Las Vegas and Beverly Hills. 

Keller is the author of five cookbooks, of which more than one million copies are in print. His award-winning “The French Laundry” cookbook debuted in 1999, followed by “Bouchon” and “Under Pressure.” He also authored “Ad Hoc at Home,” which received awards from IACP and the James Beard Foundation, in addition to appearing on The New York Times Best Sellers list for six weeks.
