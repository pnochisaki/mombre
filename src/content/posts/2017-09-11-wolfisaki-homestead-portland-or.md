It's 5am on the day we load up the rig and go live out along the Pacific Coast Highway (and probably the odd Walgreens parking lot) for the next couple of months...

With a toddler who is *in every way imaginable* two years old.
And our new rescue dog who is absolutely precious in every way, except for this one time the other day when we off-handedly noticed that she will suddenly lunge off the porch and try to rip the throat out of a passing-by pit bull...

While home schooling our 1st grader (Road schooling? World schooling? Hell if I know, I'm totes winging this).
And husband attempts to take his usually scheduled conference calls for all those important, pretty websites he makes for people... From the front seat of a van?

Sooo, yup, off we go then!
