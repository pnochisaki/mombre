... 12 hours later, several minor-ish mishaps, travel planning & packing weary, and we're finally-finally-finally off. Which means we'll be setting up our first camp with our first pop-up camper in the dark, can I get a hip hip!!
No, we didn't spend much time getting to know the ins and outs of our new digs before setting sail, which makes me take pause now...
Also, our fake smiles are nothing to write home about. Hopefully this time tomorrow we'll have actual real-life smiles to show you. 
If we don't die.
