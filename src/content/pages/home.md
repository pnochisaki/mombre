  True to the reputation of its founders, K+M takes chocolate in an innovative,
  delicious and healthy direction. Our bars benefit from the addition of a small
  amount of Armando Manni’s exquisite organic extra-virgin olive oil in place of
  cocoa butter. The olive oil imbues the chocolate with a silken texture and
  boosts the antioxidant levels, while facilitating the expression of the
  intricate cocoa bean flavors.
