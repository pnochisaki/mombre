headline2: The Process
copy2_1: >-
  The cocoa bean is naturally high in antioxidants that not only provide much of
  the aroma and flavor of chocolate but also offer a wide range of health
  benefits. Standard methods used today for turning cocoa beans into chocolate
  can result in the loss of 60 percent or more of those antioxidants.<br><br>  Hand-crafted in the Napa Valley, our cacao undergoes a unique process to
  preserve the beanâ€™s antioxidant properties. MANNI organic extra-virgin oil is
  used in place of cocoa butter to increase the antioxidant activity.

  <a href="#doc">Traveling around the world</a>,  we source the finest cocoa
  beans directly from farmers who become our partners, not just growing the
  beans, but also in the supply chain.<br><br>Our chocolatier, Chi Bui, evaluates each new type of bean in conjunction with
  the University of Florence to understand the antioxidant potential of the
  cocoa in chocolate bar form. In a pilot study, we have found that our
  proprietary chocolate-making process retains three times the amount of
  antioxidants versus the common method.

headline3: The K+M story
copy3_1: >-
  As the first and only American-born chef to hold multiple three-star ratings
  from the prestigious Michelin Guide, Thomas Keller has established a
  reputation for excellence unparalleled in American cuisine. In Tuscany,
  Armando Manni has forged a similar reputation for quality by producing
  super-antioxidant, extra-virgin olive oil.

  Together, they have spent the past five years on a unique mission: crafting a
  chocolate unlike we have seen before. They have collaborated with the
  University of Florence and chocolatier Chi Bui to develop a new methodology to
  preserve the naturally occurring antioxidants in the cocoa beans. This
  proprietary process produces delicious, complex chocolate that draws the full
  potential out of every bean.
