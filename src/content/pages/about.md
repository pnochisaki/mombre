The late, great David Bowie said it best when he sang, “Ch-ch-ch-changes”... And 2017 was a year chock full of ‘em. Our political climate shifted severely, our dog died unexpectedly, “someone” turned 40, and our insanely beautiful Columbia River Gorge burned to a crisp. Blow by blow, we finally realized we could either sit here and wallow and complain and teach our kids how to grow up and do the same, or, we could try and teach them how to rise above. The best decision we made, hands down, was not sending Oscar back to school for 1st grade, which was born from our mutual, heartfelt refusal to join the rat race. We chose instead to homeschool, which morphed into this whole new lifestyle for us all, _roam_ school. We got a quirky new rescue dog, Gertie (“Gigi” if you’re a 2 year old not yet proficient in the english language), we traded in our obligatory Portland-issued subaru for a pop-up camper and a van, and we took off for an epic two month journey down the pacific coast highway which, for some reason I’ve yet to fully understand, I began documenting here. This was all a very big deal for a certain Taurus so averse to change that her husband has to sneakily take it upon himself to update the operating system on her phone in the middle of the night without her knowing it. Fortunately we live to tell the story, and, apparently, our story continues on to whatever adventures 2018 takes us. 

Full of love, and a few more grey hairs. 
Wolfisaki’s doin’ alright.
